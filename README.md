## Description

This clearance app is structured with a cover page and subsequent modals according to the different departments as follows:
Finance department
Human Resources department
Information Systems department
Library department
The front page requires an employee enter their name, staff number and department they were working in.
By submitting these details, an employee is then able to access the different department clearance forms, where he/she indicates the duration they worked there, their supervisors name and any assets they may have received from the department and the status of those assest as regards returning them. In case they did not work at a particular department but still require clearance from the particular department, they would only be able to submit the clearance form to the concerned head of department.
On submitting the departmental forms, the employee is alerted on the status of their clearance process.
For unreturned company assets, these are listed out on the front page as a summary.
